_Life Stats_ is an application that helps users track their daily personal data, providing a personal management tool. It aims to better our lives.

## Features

### Track numeric/boolean daily data

Our daily tracking can be either numeric or boolean.

For example, amount of water drank in a day is a numeric value.

And working out is a boolean value.

The data that is tracked daily, is then displayed as graphs or mailed to the user.

The user then, have a helpful overview of their life's detailed performance.

### The Daily Form

The user tracks their data by filling forms - a custom form, which it creates.

For example, a user may have a form with the input label 'Amount of read today', for which they input a numeric value that is tracked for form's day.

The user can have several forms.

The tracked data is displayed via graphs and tables to help the user keep track of their progress, and provide motivation.

### Money Management

the users have the 'money diary', in which they track their income and expenses, and categorizes them.

The monetary data is then displayed as such:

-   Cake graphs for the expenses per category.

### Perfect Days

A form contains 'daily' goals. E.g drinking 5 glasses of water, or working out, can be marked as daily tasks.

When the day is due, it is marked 'perfect' or not, according to the dailies completed on all active forms.

The app provides a calendar view, in which perfect days are colored greed, and not perfect - red.
